Anyone who wants to access the files from user he must have permission from the owner who uploaded it on the server. We have used  AES+RSA Algorithm for encrypting the files.First User selects the files and encrypt the file using the password(user own password)by using AES Algorithm it generates a key and that key is again encrypted using RSA algorithm</p>
